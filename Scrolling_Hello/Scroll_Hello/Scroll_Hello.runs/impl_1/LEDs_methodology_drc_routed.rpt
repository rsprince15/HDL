TIMING-16#63 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.514 ns between count_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and cnt_reg[30]/CE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#64 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.514 ns between count_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and cnt_reg[31]/CE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
